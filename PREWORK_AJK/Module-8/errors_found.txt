In the div class jumbotron bg-primary text-center
The "Boo the Dog Fan Page" needed to have <h1> tags

In the About Boo section the link took you back to the same page. The link had to be placed in the href="" section of the <a> tag.

In the Image div the <img> tag was missing the <>

Boo favorite things
The contents of the ordered list need to be put into <li> tags

Needed to properly link the js file in html file. This was done by changing the name of the file in line 114.

Added comments to the JS file

Changing color box
One the javascript was linked the orange and pink buttons functions but displayed the wrong color and the green button did nothing. The problem is in the html. 
Orange button was labelled textGreen
Pink button was labelled textOrange (though properly labelled problem persisted. 
Green button was labelled textPink.
I next checked teh js file to find the Pink button problem.
In the textPink function the color change needed to be in "".

Box Grow Function
click had to be in ""


Shrink Funciton
Click had to be in ""

Random Boo Fact
First problem I found was bad indentation that hid a missing </div> tag in the html. Once this was fixed all of the boo facts showed up at the same time when clicked. 
The other problem here was in the construction of the booFacts array. Each string entry must be enclosed in "" and followed by a ,. I went through and added an opening and closing " after each comma. I then noticed that one of the entries contained a comma so I went back and fix it so that there were five entries in total.

After I found all of the errors I put the html into proper indentation.

Finally after all of this I deleted the div containing the instructions so that Boo the Dog's Fan Page can be seen by the masses without the knowledge that it once was riddled with errors.
